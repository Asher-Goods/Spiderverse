To start, make sure that your device is Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.02 versions.

Next you would need to run the bash script named "server-setup.bash" with the bash command.

After you would run:
|sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/code-server|
This command is to allow you change the default password for this method to work.

run |ifconfig| to get your IP address of the device. Then on you computer run 
http://your-ip-addr
